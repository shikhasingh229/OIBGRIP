       <p> <q>Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine
        </q> ― Nikola Tesla</p>
       <p>Nikola Tesla inventions constitute numerous technological breakthroughs throughout his lifetime. Born in Smiljan, Croatia, in 1856, the math and physics genius contributed innovations that continue to impact our lives daily today. He held over three hundred patents, but was only recognized for some, indicating many of his ideas were tested and failed or never became well known.
      <br>
        In 1882, upon graduation from the Technical University of Graz and Philosophy at the University of Prague, he drew the first sketches of his idea to build an electromagnetic motor. His first job entailed retailing DC power plants for ConEd which led to his immigration to the states in 1884.</p>

           <h2>Inventions</h2>
        <ul>
           <li class="head"><h3>Alternating Current</h3><div class="pic"><img src="icon_bolt.svg" alt="ac" srcset=""></div><li>When Tesla came to the United States, he worked for Thomas Edison in Manhattan and was promised $50,000 if he could make Edison’s direct current method successful. As it turned out, Edison’s DC current was not as effective as Tesla’s own alternating current method in transmitting electricity over long distances. When Edison reneged on his offer to pay Tesla to solve his DC power design flaws, Tesla quit and moved on to his next endeavor.
            He applied for many patents for his AC power discoveries which were later sold to Westinghouse. AC power has been widely used since its discovery and still has some applications in radio and television transmission.</li></li>
           <li class="head"><h3>Fluorescent Bulbs</h3><div class="pic"><img src="icon_bulb.svg" alt="wireless" srcset=""></div><li>Tesla did not invent fluorescent or neon lights, but he did contribute to improving both inventions. He took the lights and created the first neon sign. Tesla developed and used fluorescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry "invented" them.</li></li>
           <li class="head"><h3>X-Ray</h3><div class="pic"><img src="icon_xray.svg" alt="xray" srcset=""></div><li><br> Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to Kirlian photography, which has the ability to document life force.</li></li>
           <li class="head"><h3>Tesla Coil</h3><div class="pic"><img src="icon_coil.svg" alt="coil" srcset=""></div><li>The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a transmitter.</li></li>
           <li class="head"><h3>Electric Motor</h3><div class="pic"><img src="icon_motor.svg" alt="motor" srcset=""></div><li>Tesla's invention of a motor with rotating magnetic fields could have freed mankind much sooner from the stranglehold of Big Oil. However, his invention in 1930 succumbed to the economic crisis and the world war that followed.</li></li>
        <li class="head"><h3>Wireless Communication</h3><div class="pic"><img src="icon_wireless.svg" alt="wireless" srcset=""></div></li><li>The World Wireless System was a turn of the 20th century proposed telecommunications and electrical power delivery system designed by inventor Nikola Tesla based on his theories of using Earth and its atmosphere as electrical conductors. He claimed this system would allow for "the transmission of electric energy without wires" on a global scale as well as point-to-point wireless telecommunications and broadcasting.</li>
        <li class="head"><h3>Radio</h3><div class="pic"><img src="icon_radio.svg" alt="radio" srcset=""></div><li><br><br> Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be the inventor of radio to this day. However, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi's patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi.</li></li>
